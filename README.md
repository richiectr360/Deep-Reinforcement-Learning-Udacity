# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Udacity

Cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning algorithmsâ€”from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG).
The concepts are used to train agents to walk, drive, or perform other complex tasks.

Project 1) Navigation - Leverage neural networks to train an agent that learns intelligent behaviors from sensory data.
project 2) Continuous Control - Train a robotic arm to reach target locations, or train a four-legged virtual creature to walk.
Project 3) Collaboration and Competition - Train a system of agents to demonstrate collaboration or cooperation on a complex task.
